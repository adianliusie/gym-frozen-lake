## Frozen Lake Q learning implementation

The python script shown is my implementation of OpenAI's 8x8 [frozen lake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake8x8-v0/) enviornment. I watched [Stanford's CS234 course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html) in reinforcement learning, and in a attempt to apply the content I was trying to learn I implemented (from scratch) a model free, finite state system which uses Q learning to get the agent to make optimal decisions. In the end the agent is able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time in under 100 steps.
