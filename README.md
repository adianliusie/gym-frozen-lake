#Frozen Lake (OpenAI Gym) Q learning implementation

The python script shown is my implementation of OpenAI's 8x8 frozen lake enviornment. I watched Stanford's CS234 course in reinforcement learning, and in a attempt to apply the content I was trying to learn I decided to implement (from scratch) a model free, finite state system which uses Q learning to get the agent to make optimal decisions. In the end the agent is able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time in under 100 steps, which isn't too bad considering the agents actions are stochastic and so does not have completely control of the enviornment.
